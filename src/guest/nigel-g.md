We would also like to invite you both to the registry office, and for one of you to be a witness in our legal marriage. Unfortunately the other will have to wait in the waiting room. Don't worry, you wont be missing much. It will just be a few words and signing the register - no rings or anything.

We will be signing the register at **10 am** on **Friday 8th September**
