## The Venue
Sconner Down is a fairly basic camp site. It is partially open to the elements and partially enclosed by ever-green trees.
 
In September (as with any time of year in the UK) it may well rain. We do have wet-weather contingency plans on the site, but it will still involve dashing about through the rain &mdash; you should definitely prepare to deal with the elements.

## Recommended Kit List
 
### For everyone
- umbrella
 
### For feet
- flats, wedges or block heels
- wellies or similar if it gets wet
- stiletto heels are not a good idea!
 
### For campers
- tent, sleeping mat & bag.
- warm clothes
- torch
- check out the forecast before packing up &amp; prepare for the rain anyway.

## Transport
### Taxi
It’s best to use a Saltash Taxi company to and from the site:
- Anthony’s Taxis (7-seater): <a href="tel:+447788900222">07788 900 222</a>
- Double four taxi and minibus (8 seater) service: <a href="tel:+441752848444">01752 848 444</a>
 
### Rail
**St. Germans** station is a few miles from the site, if you let us know you plans, we can arrange pick-ups. It's on the Cornish Main Line from Plymouth to Truro/Penzance

### Car
**From the M5:**
- Take the A38 towards Plymouth
- Continue on the A38 over the Tamar Bridge.
- Keep on the A38 for another 5 or 6 miles, then at the roundabout take the 1st exit onto the A374.
- After 2 miles, pass the Halfway House Pub and take the 2nd right onto Kellow Park.
- After another 0.5 miles see the sign for Sconner Down on the left.

### Air
Nearest International Airport is Bristol (BRS). Exeter (EXT) is slightly closer for domestic flights.

Onwards to Plymouth by:
- **Bus** &mdash; the SW Falcon. For some of the SW Falcon buses you can buy cheaper tickets from the Megabus site but its still the SW Falcon service.
- **Car hire** &mdash; Favourite companies such as Hertz and Enterprise can be found at Bristol Airport. Car hire in the south west is pretty reasonable.

If you would like us to help with station pick-ups let us know.
 
## Accommodation
We would like to encourage as many of you as possible to camp with us on the site. Camping is free and there is room for camper vans, although no hook ups.
