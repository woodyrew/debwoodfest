## The Venue
We’ve chosen a quiet, secluded and wooded spot for the wedding ceremony and party.
It’s partially enclosed by ever-green trees, and partially exposed. Although we have a wet-weather plan, it will still involve dashing through the rain!

Find details about the camp site below in the accommodation section.
To help you plan we’ve put together a kit list.
