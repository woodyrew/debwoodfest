## The Venue
We’ve chosen a quiet, secluded and wooded spot for the wedding ceremony and party.
It’s partially enclosed by ever-green trees, and partially exposed. Although we have a wet-weather plan, it will still involve dashing through the rain!

Find details about the camp site below in the accommodation section.
To help you plan we’ve put together a kit list.

## Recommended Kit List

### For everyone
- Normal wedding attire
- biodegradable confetti
- torch
- umbrella *
- warm clothes *
- wellies or similar *
- flats, wedges or block heels
- stiletto heels are not a good idea!

_* Just in case_

### For campers
- tent, sleeping mat & bag.
- check out the forecast before packing up &amp; prepare for the rain anyway.

## Transport
### Taxi
It’s best to use a Saltash Taxi company to and from the site:
- Anthony’s Taxis (7-seater): <a href="tel:+447788900222">07788 900 222</a>
- Double four taxi and minibus (8 seater) service: <a href="tel:+441752848444">01752 848 444</a>

### Rail
**St. Germans** station is a few miles from the site, if you let us know you plans, we can arrange pick-ups. It's on the Cornish Main Line from Plymouth to Truro/Penzance

### Car
**From the M5:**
- Take the A38 towards Plymouth
- Continue on the A38 over the Tamar Bridge.
- Keep on the A38 for another 5 or 6 miles, then at the roundabout take the 1st exit onto the A374.
- After 2 miles, pass the Halfway House Pub and take the 2nd right onto Kellow Park.
- After another 0.5 miles see the sign for Sconner Down on the left.

### Air
Nearest International Airport is Bristol (BRS). Exeter (EXT) is slightly closer for domestic flights.

Onwards to Plymouth by:
- **Bus** &mdash; the SW Falcon. For some of the SW Falcon buses you can buy cheaper tickets from the Megabus site but its still the SW Falcon service.
- **Car hire** &mdash; Favourite companies such as Hertz and Enterprise can be found at Bristol Airport. Car hire in the south west is pretty reasonable.

If you would like us to help with station pick-ups let us know.

## Accommodation
We would like to encourage as many of you as possible to camp with us on the site. Camping is free and there is room for camper vans, although no hook ups.
