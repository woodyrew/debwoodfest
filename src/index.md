## _Accommodation:_
### Camping
We would like to encourage as many of you as possible to camp with us on site. 
Camping is free and there is plenty of room for tents and camper vans, although no hook ups.
Facilities at the camp site are fairly basic - Toilets; showers; huge fire dish; electrical sockets in shower rooms and kitchen areas; open kitchen barn with potable water, kettle, microwave; fridge.

### Bell Tents
If you like, we can arrange [Bell Tent hire](https://www.dropbox.com/s/o6r194nbhmebtbx/Hire%20prices%20Wedding%202017.pdf?dl=1): Please let us know and we'll get the ball rolling.

### Hotels
Nearby find [The Crooked Inn](http://www.crooked-inn.co.uk/). To Book - call them directly on 01752 848177.
I will continue to search for decent guest houses and B&amp;B's in the area. None stand out so far.


## _Transport:_
### Rail
**St. Germans** station is a few miles from the site, if you let us know you plans, we can arrange pick-ups. It's on the Cornish Main Line from Plymouth to Truro/Penzance

### Car
**From the M5:**
- Take the A38 towards Plymouth
- Continue on the A38 over the Tamar Bridge.
- Keep on the A38 for another 5 or 6 miles, then at the roundabout take the 1st exit onto the A374.
- After 2 miles, pass the Halfway House Pub and take the 2nd right onto Kellow Park.
- After another 0.5 miles see the sign for Sconner Down on the left.

### Air
Nearest International Airport is Bristol (BRS). Exeter (EXT) is slightly closer for domestic flights.

Onwards to Plymouth by:
- **Bus** &mdash; the SW Falcon. For some of the SW Falcon buses you can buy cheaper tickets from the Megabus site but its still the SW Falcon service.
- **Car hire** &mdash; Favourite companies such as Hertz and Enterprise can be found at Bristol Airport. Car hire in the south west is pretty reasonable.

If you would like us to help with station pick-ups let us know.

### Taxi
